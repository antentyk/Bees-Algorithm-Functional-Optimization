# Bees-Algorithm-Functional-Optimization

Bees algorithm is used for combinatorial and functional optimisation. In this repository you can find examples of using this algorithm to find minimum of following functions: Holder, Griewank, Drop wave, Cross in tray, Michaelewicz and Shubert.

We have used matplotlib for visualization & ImageMagick for creating gifs.

You can see algorithm working in folder samples.
